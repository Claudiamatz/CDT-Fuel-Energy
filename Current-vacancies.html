          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background: </span>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project is to investigate the
creep and creep fatigue behaviours of CSEF power plant steels subject to
realistic plant loading cycles. <br>
          <br>The current market conditions are such that
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants are now considering double two-shift
operation, so potentially accruing upwards of 600 starts per year. The pressure
to reduce the extent of pressure system inspections and repairs continues to
increase, with the most recent capacity auction clearing prices for generation
showing a significant reduction when compared to previous years. For operators
of large generation facilities, the key consideration is the through life revenue
return, which will guide decisions on new plant builds and any capital
investments on plant currently operating. On this basis the need for effective
life prediction and condition monitoring tools to support the supply chain
(designer, fabricator, operator and technical service provider) is evident. <br>
          <br>Over the years, significant development has been
made on the 9–12%Cr creep strength enhanced ferritic (CSEF) steels.
Traditionally, in material development for power plant components, creep
ductility, which can be treated as resistance to damage, has received much less
attention. However, the risk of catastrophic failure due to low damage
tolerance is a real challenge, in particular, in the situation where mechanical
and metallurgical constraints are present. In addition, due to the increasing
frequency of cyclic operations, i.e. starts up and shut downs for main steam
pipelines of power plants, low cycle creep fatigue failure due to low ductility
of the materials has become an important concern. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project is to investigate creep
and creep fatigue behaviour which takes into account the variable ductility for
CSEF power plant steels subject to realistic plant loading cycles, through a
comprehensive theoretical, experimental and computational programme.<br>
          <br><b>Specific objectives will include:</b>

review on the currently available models and assessment procedure.</li>
          <li>Experimental investigation of LCF behaviour and

(possibly MARBN).</li>
          <li>Development of a cyclic visco-plasticity model

          <li>Application of the model for component
assessment using plant operational data and considering typical plant component
geometries and plant operator requirements for condition assessment.</li>

conveying in pipes will be further developed to analyse a wide range of biomass
particle flow conditions. <br>
          <br>A novel biomass particle roping rig will be built
to investigate roping and its link to biomass particle size and shape. Roping
mitigation strategies will be developed, which will then be verified on a
laboratory vertical spindle mill with pneumatic classification. <br>

        </p>
        <p class="u-text u-text-3">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>We are seeking applicants with a process
engineering background to start in Autumn 2022 on a project with Mitsubishi
Chemical UK Ltd. The funded studentship is the result of a major expansion of a
programme to decarbonise the entire value chain around acrylic polymer
manufacturing. Chemical recycling of current and legacy acrylic materials is a
key challenge that needs to be met in order to realise the broader
decarbonisation programme, and microwave heating has been identified as a key
enabling technology that can meet this challenge. Mitsubishi Chemical have
partnered with the University of Nottingham to carry out this work due to their
world-leading expertise in microwave heating technologies. The partnership aims
to better understand the impact of material properties and processing
conditions on recycled product and its ability to displace fossil resources in
the acrylic manufacturing process. A continuous, industrial-scale demonstration
process will be developed towards the end of the programme. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project will be to gain better
understanding of how both microwave and conventional heating technologies can
be used to process waste plastic and produce monomer product that is of
sufficient quality to re-use in acrylic manufacture. Working with the industry
partner, other PhD students and project team members, you will establish and model concepts for refining feedstock and crude monomer to
the required quality, where challenges will be around variable feedstock
composition and the separation of close-boiling components. These refining
processes will be combined with new technologies for acrylic recycling to
produce a number of system-level process models that can be used to establish
feedstock-technology-product relationships. These models will in turn be used
to direct technology development for recycling processes and to develop a
broader industry implementation strategy for recycled acrylic, optimising the
acrylic circular value chain. <br>
          <br>This is an excellent opportunity for an
enthusiastic first or upper second class graduate with a relevant STEM or engineering background to develop expertise and key skills in the sustainable manufacture
and recycling of plastics, and to establish relationships with international
academic and industrial partners. <br>
          <br>The project will be part of the EPSRC-supported
Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) "Resilient Decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems".
The student who undertakes it will be one of a cohort of over 50 students in a
broad range of disciplines across the Universities of Sheffield, Nottingham and
Cardiff.

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Improving the water-handling of proton exchange membrane cells</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are a key
technology in enabling the transition to net-zero carbon energy.&nbsp; Hydrogen powered fuel cell stacks have been
demonstrated to be eminently suitable for powering cars and especially trucks,
because battery solutions are not viable for most larger vehicles. A recent
Hydrogen Council report (link below) emphasises the synergy in using both
battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to
have a major impact on transport derived CO2 emissions. The heavy duty truck
market is expected to be the first to become fully commercialised FCEV
application due to the less-demanding infrastructure network requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>However, a key issue severely impacting the performance and efficiency
of PEMFCs is water flooding. Water flooding occurs in the cathode-side catalyst
layer whereby water generated in the cathode reaction condenses out in the
pores of the catalyst support thereby blocking access for in-coming oxygen.
Hydrophobic ionomer is added to the cathode catalyst layer to attempt to
mitigate against flooding. In order to design the optimal formulation and
fabrication process for the cathode catalyst layer, it is necessary to
understand the relationship between the properties of the layer, especially
pore size, pore connectivity and surface wettability/hydrophobicity, and the
performance in the actual PEMFC. However, it has been found that current
characterisation methods used are unable to distinguish sufficiently between
the pore network and wettability characteristics of different layers to predict
differences in their eventual PEMFC performance. Hence, new characterisation
techniques are needed, and this is the aim of this project. The objectives of
this project are to test three such candidate techniques for suitability. NMR
spectroscopy and relaxometry of hyperpolarised (hp) krypton and xenon have been
shown to be sensitive probes of pore size and the spatial distribution of
hydro-phobic/-philic surfaces within a probed network. We, thus, intend to test
hp Kr and hp Xe NMR techniques for determining the spatial distribution of
ionomer and inception of water adsorption within cathode pore networks. The
second candidate is adsorption calorimetry. Previous combined gravimetric and calorimetric
studies of gas uptake in gas shales have suggested the technique can readily
assess the spatial arrangement and juxtaposition of pore condensate in complex
geometries, and its impact on mass transport. This technique will also be tried
on catalyst layers. Finally, serial water adsorption and mercury porosimetry
studies on catalyst pellets have revealed that this method can characterise the
spatial distribution of the adsorbed water and the impact on percolation
pathways within the pore network, and will thus be tested on cathode catalyst
layers. We will also aim to develop a characterisation technique that can be
used as a quality control, near-to-line measurement during manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <br>You will help accelerate the availability of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>According to the UK Hydrogen Strategy
published in 2021, UK will largely depend on green hydrogen fuel to decarbonise
heating, transport, industrial and other sectors to meet 2050 emission targets.
Green hydrogen fuel is produced using electrolysers (which split water into
hydrogen and oxygen) powered by electricity generated from renewable energy
sources such as solar or wind energy sources. Alkaline electrolysers, compared
to other electrolysers, are reliable and cheap. Clean Power Hydrogen (CPH2) has
developed a novel and efficient membrane free alkaline electrolysers which
employ very cheap materials, thus substantially reducing the cost of the water
electrolysis system and boosting the adoption of this green hydrogen generating
technology.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This project looks for ways to further
improve the efficiency and the durability of the membrane-free electrolysers
through investigating new materials, surface-treatments and/or designs.
Particular attention is to be given to the materials of the electrodes where
the oxygen and hydrogen evolution half reactions take place. In this regard,
alternative materials will be investigated and shortlisted based on their
efficiency, durability, and corrosion-resistance. These materials will be
ex-situ and in-situ tested. Further, multiphysics models simulating the
corrosion process and/or the operation of the electrolyser will be developed to
shorten the design cycles and obtain insights on how to improve the performance
and the lifetime of the electrolyser.<br>
          <br>Applications are welcome from graduates with a
relevant STEM or engineering background. A background in
electrochemistry, corrosion studies, electrolyser technology, and/or modelling
and simulation are desirable but not essential. This project is industrially sponsored by CPH2 which is a
leading electrolyser manufacturer in South Yorkshire that develops a unique
membrane free electrolyser. You will work closely with your industry sponsor
giving you plenty of opportunity to gain more industry experience. The successful
candidates will work under the supervision of Dr Mohammed S. Ismail and Prof

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You will help to make CO2 capture both
cheaper and more compact, meaning that it can be fitted on equipment which
cannot be decarbonised by other means.</span></b><b style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>Carbon capture is considered the only technology able to
decarbonise the hard-to-abate industries. Many of these industries utilise
legacy sites with little space for large new unit operations required in
conventional carbon capture. Rotating packed beds (RPB) look to solve this
problem by intensifying carbon capture and reducing the footprint required by
up to ten times, while also significantly decreasing the capital cost of these
units. When combined with proprietary solvents, it is believed the cost of
capture can be reduced to $30/tonne CO2 in some cases, helping to
enable the rapid uptake of carbon capture and progression towards net zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>RPB are a novel technology that utilise the principles of
process intensification to enhance the performance of mass transfer processes
between fluids. Given the application of RPB to the field of CO2
capture is relatively new, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of
different process variables on the performance of the RPB that would otherwise
require a significant amount of practical experimentation to investigate.
Computational fluid dynamics can enable the process to be accurately modelled,
allowing for quick and inexpensive prediction of performance under various
conditions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> In this project a rotating packed bed absorber will be
modelled in Ansys FLUENT, with validation of the model’s outputs through use of
the 1 tonnes of CO2 per day (TPD) pilot-scale rotating packed bed
absorber at the University of Sheffield’s Translational Energy Research Centre.
Initial research will involve investigating the impact of operational
conditions and physical properties of the solvent on capture performance. As
the project continues, the scope will widen to include sensitivity analysis of
design parameters and the impact of scaling the RPB absorber on the existing project
outputs and learnings. Additionally, further rotating unit operations could
also be investigated.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> This project will utilise and develop your knowledge
surrounding CFD modelling, mass and heat transfer, reaction kinetics and
chemical equilibria. You will work closely with Carbon Clean, a global leader
in the development of carbon capture technology and pioneers in the use of RPB
for industrial decarbonisation. Your findings could directly impact the design
and operation of commercial working carbon capture facilities, supporting the
pathway to net zero.&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;"> Background:</span>
          <br>Fuel decarbonisation will impact
significantly the global reduction of anthropogenic carbon dioxide (CO2)
emissions the main source of greenhouse gas (GHGs) emissions. Ammonia (NH3)
is considered a potential carbon-free fuel and a carbon-free energy vector (carrier).
Large scale NH3 production, storage and distribution has been
commercially established on a global scale for over a century. NH3
can be produced sustainably from waste sources, and renewable energy recognised
as green-ammonia (G-NH3). Fuel blending of NH3
with either H2, LPG (liquified petroleum gas) or diesel has the
potential to enhance the combustion properties for NH3. An understanding
of the engine in-cylinder thermo-chemical kinetics governing NH3 NOx
and Thermal-NOx formation for NH3 and NH3/Fuel
Blends (H2, natural gas LPG, diesel) is required. In addition, the
NOx reduction efficiencies for selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
systems needs evaluation, to understand if changes to the catalyst formulation
are required for effectively treating exhaust gas produced from NH3 -ICE
and NH3/Fuel Blend-ICE. Therefore, it is critical for
Eminox to develop a detailed understanding of the system requirements for an
exhaust after-treatment system suitable for NH3-ICE and NH3/Fuel
Blends-ICE.&nbsp;<br>

will develop models for large-scale DAC plant (driven by wind electricity and solar heat).
We will answer the question how to design and operate such a plant; (2) No

          <br>You will work to understand the best options to decarbonise the emissions
from commercial fleet vehicles.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:<span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>
          </span>
          <br>Long haul road freight transport and the HGV market in the
UK is currently dominated by diesel powered vehicles. As the cost of fossil
fuels continue to increase, together with the inherent need to move towards
zero emission vehicle fleets, HGV fleet operators and being increasingly pushed
towards operating electric HGV’s. However, the shorter range and longer
refuelling times for eHGVs when compared to their more conventional diesel
counterparts makes this shift to lower carbon goods transport more problematic
than is the case with private passenger vehicles.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This project addresses a currently under-investigated aspect
of the government push to net zero, and the issues surrounding decarbonisation
of commercial fleet vehicles. Significant work is targeted at the technology
and societal impact of the electrification of passenger vehicles, but the
longer ranges and significantly higher utilisation of fleet HGV’s for example
make the problems of decarbonisation an order of magnitude more difficult.&nbsp; &nbsp;<b></b>
          <br>
          <br>Since commercial transport hubs are geared up to handle
palletised goods, and often are situated on the outskirts of larger cities or
close to motorways as distribution hubs. This project will examine the
technical and commercial / logistical drivers behind using palletised batteries
for supporting eHGV traction and range extending. These palletised battery
packs will act as mobile energy storage, which will be easy to handle within
the existing logistics infrastructure; they can be re-charged off vehicle at
existing hubs / depots, where the power demands of the charging can be
controlled independently to the demands on the vehicles for transportation.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>The aim of the project is to study and understand the impact
of HGV operation for example, on the energy use and decarbonisation of the
operational fleet as a whole. To this end, the student will examine the drivers
and barriers of range extending, palletised, mobile energy storage systems for
use in the commercial road transport sector. The project will encompass the fleet
operation logistics, and from that, the stored energy requirements for the
technology; alongside the technical issues surrounding the charging / grid
support, and interfacing of the proposed palletised system to existing
platforms. This will then be closely linked to the practical applications of
the industrial collaborator.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The study will also encompass the technology required to
allow the operational vehicle interfacing, together with the requirements for
the battery management system on the palletised storage. One further advantage
of this as a possible system to be explored is the ease with which the
palletised storage could be utilised as static energy storage once the
batteries / cells reach ‘end-of-life’ in the transport application, facilitating
an easier transition to second life battery use. Once the project establishes
the baselines for the energy storage requirements based on the fleet
operational constraints, these can form the base of a requirements
specification for further palletised technology, for example a fuel cell / H2
based system, for range extension, as appropriate.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>Significant expertise exists within the sponsoring company
with respect to the handling and loading / unloading of palletised goods, with
operators and vehicle drivers being familiar with the technologies involved.
The use of a familiar infrastructure as the foundation for a study into a
removable energy storage / range extender technology, covering the impact of
the fleet operational requirements and the size / space / storage needs of the
palletised energy systems, will provide a case study to provide real-world
focus to the work. The impact of the use of freight hubs as recharging
facilities on the existing grid infrastructure will also be investigated, along
with the use of on-site (and inherently out of town / on motorway network)
alternative generation technology. Thus, the industrial partner will play an
important role by enabling the research to be constrained by some of the
practical issues which surround day to day HGV logistics operations, for
example client operational requirements, vehicle routing etc.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This proposed PhD project is truly multi-disciplinary,
primarily supervised by Dr Ballantyne from the Management School, who’s
expertise and contacts lie in the field of transport logistics, and Prof Stone
from EEE, who’s background is energy storage and conversion. The inclusion of
the external partner who will support the real-world application and impact of
the research.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u>
