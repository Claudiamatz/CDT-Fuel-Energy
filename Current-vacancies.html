hydrogen fuel-producing electrolysers </h4>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Impact of the project:</span>
          <br>You will help accelerate the availability of hydrogen as a carbon-free fuel.<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>According to the UK Hydrogen Strategy
published in 2021, UK will largely depend on green hydrogen fuel to decarbonise
heating, transport, industrial and other sectors to meet 2050 emission targets.
Green hydrogen fuel is produced using electrolysers (which split water into
hydrogen and oxygen) powered by electricity generated from renewable energy
sources such as solar or wind energy sources. Alkaline electrolysers, compared
to other electrolysers, are reliable and cheap. Clean Power Hydrogen (CPH2) has
developed a novel and efficient membrane free alkaline electrolysers which
employ very cheap materials, thus substantially reducing the cost of the water
electrolysis system and boosting the adoption of this green hydrogen generating
technology.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This project looks for ways to further
improve the efficiency and the durability of the membrane-free electrolysers
through investigating new materials, surface-treatments and/or designs.
Particular attention is to be given to the materials of the electrodes where
the oxygen and hydrogen evolution half reactions take place. In this regard,
alternative materials will be investigated and shortlisted based on their
efficiency, durability, and corrosion-resistance. These materials will be
ex-situ and in-situ tested. Further, multiphysics models simulating the
corrosion process and/or the operation of the electrolyser will be developed to
shorten the design cycles and obtain insights on how to improve the performance
and the lifetime of the electrolyser.<br>
          <br>Applications are welcome from graduates with a
relevant STEM or engineering background. A background in
electrochemistry, corrosion studies, electrolyser technology, and/or modelling
and simulation are desirable but not essential. This project is industrially sponsored by CPH2 which is a
leading electrolyser manufacturer in South Yorkshire that develops a unique
membrane free electrolyser. You will work closely with your industry sponsor
giving you plenty of opportunity to gain more industry experience. The successful
candidates will work under the supervision of Dr Mohammed S. Ismail and Prof
Mohamed Pourkashanian (University of Sheffield) and Mr Ian Pillay (CPH2).&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Impact of the project:</span>
          <br><b>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You will help to make CO2 capture both
cheaper and more compact, meaning that it can be fitted on equipment which
cannot be decarbonised by other means.</span></b><b style="font-weight: 400;">&nbsp;</b>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>Carbon capture is considered the only technology able to
decarbonise the hard-to-abate industries. Many of these industries utilise
legacy sites with little space for large new unit operations required in
conventional carbon capture. Rotating packed beds (RPB) look to solve this
problem by intensifying carbon capture and reducing the footprint required by
up to ten times, while also significantly decreasing the capital cost of these
units. When combined with proprietary solvents, it is believed the cost of
capture can be reduced to $30/tonne CO2 in some cases, helping to
enable the rapid uptake of carbon capture and progression towards net zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>RPB are a novel technology that utilise the principles of
process intensification to enhance the performance of mass transfer processes
between fluids. Given the application of RPB to the field of CO2
capture is relatively new, there is uncertainty regarding the impact of
different process variables on the performance of the RPB that would otherwise
require a significant amount of practical experimentation to investigate.
Computational fluid dynamics can enable the process to be accurately modelled,
allowing for quick and inexpensive prediction of performance under various
conditions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> In this project a rotating packed bed absorber will be
modelled in Ansys FLUENT, with validation of the model’s outputs through use of
the 1 tonnes of CO2 per day (TPD) pilot-scale rotating packed bed
absorber at the University of Sheffield’s Translational Energy Research Centre.
Initial research will involve investigating the impact of operational
conditions and physical properties of the solvent on capture performance. As
the project continues, the scope will widen to include sensitivity analysis of
design parameters and the impact of scaling the RPB absorber on the existing project
outputs and learnings. Additionally, further rotating unit operations could
also be investigated.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> This project will utilise and develop your knowledge
surrounding CFD modelling, mass and heat transfer, reaction kinetics and
chemical equilibria. You will work closely with Carbon Clean, a global leader
in the development of carbon capture technology and pioneers in the use of RPB
for industrial decarbonisation. Your findings could directly impact the design
and operation of commercial working carbon capture facilities, supporting the
pathway to net zero.&nbsp;<br>

          <br>This
study aims to quantify the cost and energy reduction by carrying out a
comprehensive study of the direct air capture (DAC) process integrated with CO2
to methanol conversion process. Specific novelties of this work are: (1) Currently
there is no commercial large-scale DAC plant existing in the world. &nbsp;We
will develop models for large-scale DAC plant (driven by wind electricity and solar heat).
We will answer the question how to design and operate such a plant; (2) No
study on the integration of DAC based on electrodialysis regeneration with the
CO2 utilisation process; (3) No study on rigorous optimisation and
detailed techno-economic analysis of the DAC process integrated with CO2
conversion to methanol; (4) No study on life cycle analysis to determine the
sustainability of the DAC process integrated with CO2 conversion to
methanol.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The research on DAC will be performed through process
modelling. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle analysis will be carried out
at commercial scale.&nbsp; The research outcome will be published in journal
papers and conference papers, which will be vital for policy makers, academic
researchers and industrial practitioners.<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>Currently
there is a growing demand to reduce carbon emissions from the power and
propulsion systems. Also, there is growing concern on the impact of fossil fuel
emissions on public health of urban populations. Hydrogen has the potential of
emerging as the leading energy carrier for the next generation of zero-carbon
combustion for propulsion systems. However, the utilisation of hydrogen for
combustion is hindered by considerable challenges, such as flame instability
and flashback.
This
project aims to set out new design and operational principles for hydrogen
combustors.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> Greens Combustion are a combustion engineering company
based in Poole in Dorset, producing burners for fired heaters, reformers,
crackers, incinerators and boilers. The aim of this project is to look at the
development of a hydrogen burner for industrial applications. This research
will involve the study of the fundamentals of hydrogen combustion, heat release
and stability, culminating in a series of design guidance to deploy hydrogen
burners across heavy industries.<br>
          <br>The
selected candidate will be embedded in the Cardiff University – Centre for
Research into Energy, Waste and Environment and closely work with Greens Combustion.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>The PhD project is of
four years duration,&nbsp;<b>starting October 2022</b>, within the EPSRC Centre
for Doctor Training (CDT) “Resilient decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems”. The
studentship which will cover full university fees and a tax-free, enhanced
annual stipend. The student who undertakes it will be one of a cohort of over
50 students in a broad range of disciplines across the Universities of
Sheffield, Nottingham and Cardiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <br> This project is sponsored by
Toshiba. Hybrid electric propulsion systems uses proton exchange membrane fuel
cell (PEMFC) system with a battery to power on board electric motor. The PEMFC
converts the chemical energy of hydrogen fuel into electricity, heat and water
without carbon emissions. Power management to manage load balance between fuel
cell and battery remain the significant barriers to fuel cell to be used in
aviation. More fundamental research is then needed to overcome these barriers.
Issues such power conversion and Power management to manage load balance
between fuel cell and battery, remain the focus on fuel cell performance
improvement and reliability of the fuel cell system.&nbsp; This project need
modelling to investigate the thermal management, power distribution and control
strategy of a hybrid fuel cell system and an experimental study to validate the
power distribution, control and stability of the system. Potential benefits for
hybrid propulsion systems for aviation application will be evaluated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <br> Clean Air Power provide
automotive technology for low carbon freight. They offer decarbonisation
options through the supply of technology and components that enable the
transition to cleaner, low carbon fuels. The technology can replace diesel
through the fuelling of renewables such as hydrogen, biogas and biomethane to
the more traditional natural gas options such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). This CDT studentship will study The design and
development of a hydrogen/ammonia fuel system for a reciprocating internal
combustion engine. This will involve some studies of the fundamentals of
hydrogen / ammonia combustion, followed by deeper research into the provision
of design rules for the next generation of carbon-free engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
