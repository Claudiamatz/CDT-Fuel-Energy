        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> CPL Industries Limited is the UK’s market leader in
the manufacture and supply of smokeless solid fuel used in domestic heating.
CPL also produces a range of fuels that include renewable materials.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>CPL is currently undergoing a big push to produce
solid fuels produced purely from renewable precursors. This is due to number of
reasons, one main reason being stricter legislation around carbon emissions
being put in place with more expected&nbsp;in the near future&nbsp;to meet
emission targets. Ever increasingly biomass is being sought for using as a fuel
source. Biomass can be problematic in terms of storage and low energy density
means much more needs to be burnt to produce the same energy as coal.
Combustion of raw biomasses can also be bad for emissions targets especially in
producing particulates lowering air quality. One way to limit the volume
required to burn and therefore particulate emissions is to undergo pyrolysis
which de-volatises the biomass and increases the fixed carbon content and in
doing so, energy density. Pyrolysis is also a step required in activated carbon
production that CPL are looking towards. During pyrolysis oil and gases are
produced. The oils have potential to be used for other applications, one
example of this is the use the&nbsp;bio oils&nbsp;as a binder in the production
of renewable smokeless solid fuel briquettes.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>This brings us to another technology Hydrothermal
Carbonisation (HTC) that CPL are working to commercialise. CPL have the first
pilot scale plant in the UK at its site in Immingham. HTC is a wet biomass
conversion technology. It mimics the natural process of coal formation in just
a few hours. The&nbsp;benefits&nbsp;of hydrothermal carbonisation is that
biomass with a high moisture content is considered ideal whereas in&nbsp;the
majority of&nbsp;cases they aren’t favoured due to this moisture causing issues
without undergoing pre drying steps. Low quality biomass that is considered a
waste can undergo hydrothermal carbonisation which occurs in the liquid phase
and produces a carbon with comparable energy density as seen in wood pellets.
The by-product of this is HTC process liquor which can possibly be used as a
fertiliser if it is found to contain valuable nutrients.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>The project is geared towards the chosen student
taking these pyrolysis oils and HTC effluent and seeing what value and uses can
be extracted from them. This will include a large range of laboratory testing
for composition analysis&nbsp;and also&nbsp;real-life application testing such
as a potential renewable binder mention above. The student will be heavily
interactive with the company working alongside the R&amp;D team whom along with
Nottingham University will give support and project direction.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The aim of the PhD project is to investigate the
creep and creep fatigue behaviours of CSEF power plant steels subject to
realistic plant loading cycles. <br>
          <br>The current market conditions are such that
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants are now considering double two-shift
operation, so potentially accruing upwards of 600 starts per year. The pressure
to reduce the extent of pressure system inspections and repairs continues to
increase, with the most recent capacity auction clearing prices for generation
showing a significant reduction when compared to previous years. For operators
of large generation facilities, the key consideration is the through life revenue
return, which will guide decisions on new plant builds and any capital
investments on plant currently operating. On this basis the need for effective
life prediction and condition monitoring tools to support the supply chain
(designer, fabricator, operator and technical service provider) is evident. <br>
          <br>Over the years, significant development has been
made on the 9–12%Cr creep strength enhanced ferritic (CSEF) steels.
Traditionally, in material development for power plant components, creep
ductility, which can be treated as resistance to damage, has received much less
attention. However, the risk of catastrophic failure due to low damage
tolerance is a real challenge, in particular, in the situation where mechanical
and metallurgical constraints are present. In addition, due to the increasing
frequency of cyclic operations, i.e. starts up and shut downs for main steam
pipelines of power plants, low cycle creep fatigue failure due to low ductility
of the materials has become an important concern. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project is to investigate creep
and creep fatigue behaviour which takes into account the variable ductility for
CSEF power plant steels subject to realistic plant loading cycles, through a
comprehensive theoretical, experimental and computational programme.<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The current market conditions are such that
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants are now considering double two-shift
operation, so potentially accruing upwards of 600 starts per year. This
increased thermal cycling has a detrimental effect on component life. One
critical component is the gas turbine rotor. The ability to accurately
calculate the remaining life of the rotors through prediction of creep and
fatigue damage will enable reduction of financial and environmental costs associated
with premature replacement. Ultimately these cost reductions could benefit the
consumer and the economy. <br>
          <br>RWE Generation operates gas (CCGT), biofuel and
coal power stations across Europe. It is one of the largest electricity
generation companies within Europe. Since its power station components operate
at high temperatures and pressures, RWE has technical interest in component
life prediction and extension through modelling, plant performance
optimisation, metallurgy, welding and new materials. <br>
          <br>A previous research programme, conducted over the
last 3 years at Nottingham, has involved development of a visco-plastic
material model for one of the rotor steels, determination of the material model
parameters through experimental testing and development of a finite element
model of the rotor with some limited life prediction capability. <br>
          <br>The aim of the current project is to continue this

fracture mechanics to develop a test for the critical particle size for

in a lab scale vertical spindle mill. <br>
          <br>The fundamental science behind classification will
be investigated to ascertain the impact of biomass particle size and shape on
classification and linked back to milling fracture mechanics. A model will be

manufacturing. Chemical recycling of current and legacy acrylic materials is a
key challenge that needs to be met in order to realise the broader
decarbonisation programme, and microwave heating has been identified as a key
enabling technology that can meet this challenge. Mitsubishi Chemical have
partnered with the University of Nottingham to carry out this work due to their
world-leading expertise in microwave heating technologies. The partnership aims
to better understand the impact of material properties and processing
conditions on recycled product and its ability to displace fossil resources in
the acrylic manufacturing process. A continuous, industrial-scale demonstration
process will be developed towards the end of the programme. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project will be to gain better
understanding of how both microwave and conventional heating technologies can
be used to process waste plastic and produce monomer product that is of
sufficient quality to re-use in acrylic manufacture. Working with the industry
partner, other PhD students and project team members the successful candidate
will establish and model concepts for refining feedstock and crude monomer to
the required quality, where challenges will be around variable feedstock
composition and the separation of close-boiling components. These refining
processes will be combined with new technologies for acrylic recycling to
produce a number of system-level process models that can be used to establish
feedstock-technology-product relationships. These models will in turn be used
to direct technology development for recycling processes and to develop a
broader industry implementation strategy for recycled acrylic, optimising the
acrylic circular value chain. <br>
          <br>This is an excellent opportunity for an
enthusiastic first or upper second class graduate in a process engineering
discipline to develop expertise and key skills in the sustainable manufacture
and recycling of plastics, and to establish relationships with international
academic and industrial partners. <br>
          <br>The project will be part of the EPSRC-supported
Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) "Resilient Decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems".
The student who undertakes it will be one of a cohort of over 50 students in a
broad range of disciplines across the Universities of Sheffield, Nottingham and
Cardiff.
