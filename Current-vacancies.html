It is supported by a first phase of eight commercial scale projects across multiple industrial sectors aiming to start operation before 2030.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>One key application of Carbon Capture and Storage technologies is the removal of carbon dioxide from industrial and combustion gases before they enter the atmosphere, e.g. from combined cycle gas turbine power plants, energy from waste plants and industrial facilities in cement, steel, chemical, glass, paper and ceramic.&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br> Transitioning chemicals and fuels production towards net
zero ambitions requires securing abundant, affordable, low carbon, and
renewable feedstocks. This requires consideration of competition for limited
feedstock sources between a diversity of applications, and careful balancing of

          <br>This PhD project will develop novel life cycle assessment
and techno-economic approaches to assess potential feedstock supply chains for
low carbon and renewable chemicals production. The comprehensive approach
undertaken will consider: current and future availability of feedstock sources
in UK and globally; emerging process technologies for the pre-treatment and
conversion of feedstocks; the competitiveness of end users and alternative
decarbonisation strategies to anticipate best uses of limited feedstocks. You
will have the opportunity to develop expertise in innovative tools and
methodologies for assessing the environmental and financial implications of
deploying emerging technologies in the chemicals sector.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>During the PhD, you will work closely with industrial
partner Mitsubishi Chemical Group and an interdisciplinary research team at
University of Nottingham and University College London, providing exciting
opportunities to better understand the potential role of renewable chemicals in
meeting industrial and national net zero ambitions.<br>
          <br>Key requirements:<br>- A degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, or equivalent (MEng high 2:1 or above; exception BEng candidates will also be considered)<br>- Excellent technical written and verbal skills<br>- Strong time management and ability to meet deadlines<br>- Ability to work both independently and as part of a team<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">About Durham Filtration:</span>
          <br> Durham Filtration Ltd. has the strategic intent to
become a renowned technical authority in the field of flue-gas filtration for
large-scale industrial combustion plants, particularly in the Energy-from-Waste
and Biomass Energy markets of the UK and Europe. We have invested heavily in
R&amp;D to support this aim over the past 5 years with projects placed at
Universities of Newcastle, Teesside and Sheffield in addition to KTP
collaborations.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Our main business lies in providing filtration services
to waste to energy and biomass plant operated by Viridor, Veolia, Sembcorp,
Suez and E.On using combustion and gasification technologies.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We aim to provide best practice filtration technologies,
continuous improvement and innovative solutions for financial and environmental
benefits. In return, we have access to plant and commercial data and the
ability to trial our innovations using industrial samples or at full commercial
scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">R &amp; D plans:</span>
          <br>DF have plans to recruit 4 PhD students in total on an
annual basis to assist in developing our R &amp; D effort in support of our
commercial activities. DF envisage, should the opportunities arise, that these
students could grow with the company as it expands its activities in this
expanding sector as the UK engages with technologies that assist in reducing
CO2 emissions. DF have benefited from this recruitment route in recent years.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We have a plan to enhance our capability at our Jarrow
Facility and have constructed a filtration characterisation and testing
laboratory, which allows us to conduct all the current industry standard
measurements for post-operational flue gas filtration media. We are aware of
the plans of Sheffield University to recover from the flooding at Beighton and
we are committed to enhancing our current lab capabilities by constructing a
new filtration and combustion characterisation laboratory. This new facility
will leverage the existing knowhow within Sheffield University and will serve
to replace much of the capability formerly located at the Beighton pilot facility,
whilst also evolving the University’s capability to reflect current industrial
needs. We have allowed for a significant footprint of our Jarrow facility to be
used for this purpose, with room for expansion in mind.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Durham Filtration intends to work with Sheffield
University to develop our next-generation of innovations for our customers.
This includes a commitment to support EngD and PhD candidates with industrial
placements, supervise and mentor final year undergraduates with industrially
relevant research, and fund KTP associates. We will also commit to jointly
pursuing additional funding and grants as may be relevant to the research, and
to jointly deliver all impacts, outputs and deliverables required to fulfil the
conditions of the same.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We
envisage that this phase in our growth strategy will last at least four years,
during which time we will actively pursue, fund and support commercialisation
and publication of our jointly developed innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">EngD proposal:</span>
          <br>Currently, there is an expansion in the UK for the
provision of power and heat from waste to energy and biomass combustion plant
which assist the UK Government in its goal to reduce CO2 emissions while
solving disposal problems. However, this type of plant generates particulate
emissions, <br> particularly
PM2.5, which provides technological challenges in their control due to their
size and health hazard potential. Increasingly stringent emissions control
legislation means that existing technology will need to be improved while
maintaining operational efficiency. This provides challenges to minimise outage
caused by filter failures in baghouses where higher performance filter
installation can highlight weaknesses in designs related to optimisation of flue
gas flow patterns as well as identification of regions of high material
stresses by simulation work.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>It
is recognised that particulate control from biomass gasification processes
presents different sets of challenges and we will work with customers using
this technology to offer improved systems as an outcome from the areas of
research proposed below.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>To assist in developing these high specification
systems, DF would like to sponsor an EngD student to start in September 2023
from the Resilient Decarbonisation CDT at Sheffield. DF have plans to fund up
to 4 PhD students and we have outlined below the proposed topics. All projects
are related to particulate emissions control from energy from waste and biomass
combustion/gasification plant.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The exact project will be decided
after interview with students to match interests and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Topics:</b>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">About the project</span>:<br>
          <br>It is essential to decarbonise carbon
dioxide emissions from fossil fuels to achieve the carbon neutrality of the
Paris Climate Change agreement. One key application of Carbon Capture and
Storage technologies is the removal of carbon dioxide from industrial and
combustion gases before they enter the atmosphere.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The project aims to design and optimise a
novel concept for contacting combustion gases with solvents used for CO2&nbsp;capture in
combined cycle gas turbines. It uses a first of a kind prototype system to
obtain experimental data and combines the data with process modelling to obtain
the first optimised configuration. The project has three objectives:&nbsp;<br>
          <br><!--[if !supportLists]-->1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Generate data on the pressure drop, hydrodynamics and mass
transfer of novel packing geometries used for contacting industrial gases with
CO2&nbsp;capture
solvents.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Characterise the operation of the prototype contact for a range
of CO2&nbsp;capture
solvent physical properties, such as density, viscosity and surface tension.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Develop engineering guidelines for process optimisation and
scale-up with open-access 35%wt MEA solvent supported by new packing data from
this project.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <br>The output of the project will inform
commercial decisions by the industrial partner to decarbonise offshore
platforms. It will also explore configurations for other applications related
to CO2&nbsp;capture.<br>
