          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>The impact of carbon-based
deposits on climate change and human health is the driver for legislation, fuel
technology change and engineering&nbsp;
improvements. The carbon species produced by the internal combustion
engine have various impacts on emissions and despite many years of research are
still not fully understood. Recent work at Nottingham1-3 has shown a
paradigm shift in the understanding of these deposits and has had subsequent
impact in their reduction.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The work has informed industry
produce to develop mitigation chemistries to be produced and thus reduce
emissions. The project is a unique opportunity to use very sophisticated
surface science techniques such as Orbitrap 3D secondary ion mass spectrometry
(SIMS) and X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). The study will involve
carbon material from across the powertrain vista, road, rail, off road, marine,
and standing. The material will be associated with injector deposits, filter
deposits to enable emission reduction and soot, especially those associated
with respiratory inflammation cardiovascular health problems and premature
mortality. The information regarding the structure of these species will be
used to invent mitigation strategies for the benefit of all. Though the work is
focussed on carbon this is a unique opportunity to learn to use and interpret
data from “state of the art” instrumentation yielding important portability
skill sets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The University of Nottingham is
a World leading research institute. It is ranked 7th seventh in the
UK for research Power, which takes into account a combination of the quality of
our research, its international impact, critical mass and sustainability. In

Rotating Packed Beds using CFD Modelling </h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2">
          <span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Impact of the project:</span>
          <br>You will help to make
CO2 capture both cheaper and more compact, meaning that it can be fitted on
equipment which cannot be decarbonised by other means.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Carbon capture is a
critical technology in achieving net zero and keeping global temperature rise
within 1.5 degrees.&nbsp;This project will develop the next generation capture
technology for decarbonizing the energy and industrial sectors. You will be
trained to become a world leading researcher and engineer in advanced carbon
capture technologies with much needed CFD modelling skills applicable to a wide
range of industrial sectors.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>Carbon capture is
considered the only technology able to decarbonise the hard-to-abate
industries. Many of these industries utilise legacy sites with little space for
large new unit operations required in conventional carbon capture. Rotating packed
beds (RPB) look to solve this problem by intensifying carbon capture and
reducing the footprint required by up to ten times, while also significantly
decreasing the capital cost of these units. When combined with proprietary
solvents, it is believed the cost of capture can be reduced to $30/tonne CO2 in
some cases, helping to enable the rapid uptake of carbon capture and
progression towards net zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>RPB are a novel
technology that utilise the principles of process intensification to enhance
the performance of mass transfer processes between fluids. Given the
application of RPB to the field of CO2 capture is relatively new, there is
uncertainty regarding the impact of different process variables on the
performance of the RPB that would otherwise require a significant amount of
practical experimentation to investigate. Computational fluid dynamics can
enable the process to be accurately modelled, allowing for quick and
inexpensive prediction of performance under various conditions.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>In this project a rotating
packed bed absorber will be modelled in Ansys FLUENT, with validation of the
model’s outputs through use of the 1 tonnes of CO2 per day (TPD) pilot-scale
rotating packed bed absorber at the University of Sheffield’s Translational
Energy Research Centre. Initial research will involve investigating the impact
of operational conditions and physical properties of the solvent on capture
performance. As the project continues, the scope will widen to include
sensitivity analysis of design parameters and the impact of scaling the RPB
absorber on the existing project outputs and learnings. Additionally, further
rotating unit operations could also be investigated.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This project will
utilise and develop your knowledge surrounding CFD modelling, mass and heat transfer,
reaction kinetics and chemical equilibria. You will work closely with Carbon
Clean, a global leader in the development of carbon capture technology and
pioneers in the use of RPB for industrial decarbonisation. Your findings could
directly impact the design and operation of commercial working carbon capture
facilities, supporting the pathway to net zero.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>

          <br>This
study aims to quantify the cost and energy reduction by carrying out a
comprehensive study of the direct air capture (DAC) process integrated with CO2
to methanol conversion process. Specific novelties of this work are: (1) Currently
there is no commercial large-scale DAC plant existing in the world. &nbsp;We
will develop models for large-scale DAC plant (driven by wind electricity and solar heat).
We will answer the question how to design and operate such a plant; (2) No
study on the integration of DAC based on electrodialysis regeneration with the
CO2 utilisation process; (3) No study on rigorous optimisation and
detailed techno-economic analysis of the DAC process integrated with CO2
conversion to methanol; (4) No study on life cycle analysis to determine the
sustainability of the DAC process integrated with CO2 conversion to
methanol.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The research on DAC will be performed through process
modelling. Techno-economic analysis and life cycle analysis will be carried out
at commercial scale.&nbsp; The research outcome will be published in journal
papers and conference papers, which will be vital for policy makers, academic
researchers and industrial practitioners.<i>&nbsp;</i>&nbsp;<br>

          <br>Currently
there is a growing demand to reduce carbon emissions from the power and
propulsion systems. Also, there is growing concern on the impact of fossil fuel
emissions on public health of urban populations. Hydrogen has the potential of
emerging as the leading energy carrier for the next generation of zero-carbon
combustion for propulsion systems. However, the utilisation of hydrogen for
combustion is hindered by considerable challenges, such as flame instability
and flashback.
This
project aims to set out new design and operational principles for hydrogen
combustors.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> Greens Combustion are a combustion engineering company
based in Poole in Dorset, producing burners for fired heaters, reformers,
crackers, incinerators and boilers. The aim of this project is to look at the
development of a hydrogen burner for industrial applications. This research
will involve the study of the fundamentals of hydrogen combustion, heat release
and stability, culminating in a series of design guidance to deploy hydrogen
burners across heavy industries.<br>
          <br>The
selected candidate will be embedded in the Cardiff University – Centre for
Research into Energy, Waste and Environment and closely work with Greens Combustion.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>Currently
there is a growing demand to reduce carbon emissions from the power and
propulsion systems. Also, there is growing concern on the impact of fossil fuel
emissions on public health of urban populations. Hydrogen has the potential of
emerging as the leading energy carrier for the next generation of zero-carbon
combustion for propulsion systems. However, the utilisation of hydrogen for
combustion is hindered by considerable challenges, such as flame instability
and flashback.
This
project aims to set out new design and operational principles for hydrogen
combustors.&nbsp;<br>
          <br> Clean Air Power provide
automotive technology for low carbon freight. They offer decarbonisation
options through the supply of technology and components that enable the
transition to cleaner, low carbon fuels. The technology can replace diesel
through the fuelling of renewables such as hydrogen, biogas and biomethane to
the more traditional natural gas options such as Compressed Natural Gas (CNG)
and Liquid Natural Gas (LNG). This CDT studentship will study The design and
development of a hydrogen/ammonia fuel system for a reciprocating internal
combustion engine. This will involve some studies of the fundamentals of
hydrogen / ammonia combustion, followed by deeper research into the provision
of design rules for the next generation of carbon-free engines.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The
selected candidate will be embedded in the Cardiff University – Centre for
Research into Energy, Waste and Environment and closely work with Clean Air Power.&nbsp; &nbsp;<br>
          <br>The PhD project is of
four years duration,&nbsp;<b>starting October 2023</b>, within the EPSRC Centre
for Doctor Training (CDT) “Resilient decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems”. The
studentship which will cover full university fees and a tax-free, enhanced
annual stipend. The student who undertakes it will be one of a cohort of over
50 students in a broad range of disciplines across the Universities of
Sheffield, Nottingham and Cardiff.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br> Transitioning chemicals and fuels production towards net
zero ambitions requires securing abundant, affordable, low carbon, and
renewable feedstocks. This requires consideration of competition for limited
feedstock sources between a diversity of applications, and careful balancing of
objectives related to land and resource management.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This PhD project will develop novel life cycle assessment
and techno-economic approaches to assess potential feedstock supply chains for
low carbon and renewable chemicals production. The comprehensive approach
undertaken will consider: current and future availability of feedstock sources
in UK and globally; emerging process technologies for the pre-treatment and
conversion of feedstocks; the competitiveness of end users and alternative
decarbonisation strategies to anticipate best uses of limited feedstocks. You
will have the opportunity to develop expertise in innovative tools and
methodologies for assessing the environmental and financial implications of
deploying emerging technologies in the chemicals sector.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>During the PhD, you will work closely with industrial
partner Mitsubishi Chemical Group and an interdisciplinary research team at
University of Nottingham and University College London, providing exciting
opportunities to better understand the potential role of renewable chemicals in
meeting industrial and national net zero ambitions.<br>
          <br>Key requriements:<br>- A degree in chemical engineering, mechanical engineering, or equivalent (MEng high 2:1 or above; exception BEng candidates will also be considered)<br>- Excellent technical written and verbal skills<br>- Strong time management and ability to meet deadlines<br>- Ability to work both independently and as part of a team<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;"></span>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">Background:</span>
          <br>This
project aims to advance clean air technology for combustion gas management of exhaust
from current engines fuelled by gasoline and diesel, but also for new and
future generation technology. Vehicle emissions legislation is tightening
around the world, including the recently published EUVII standards, and there
is a continuing focus on the health consequences of particulate emissions from
internal combustion engines (ICE). To meet legislation over the whole range of driving
conditions, exhaust filters for current diesel and gasoline exhaust
applications may face the challenging requirement of greater than 99.9%
filtration efficiency without negatively affecting catalytic performance and
fuel efficiency. This stringent filtration target can only be met by gaining a deep
understanding of fluid flows in the porous filter medium, both of catalytic
coating liquids during manufacturing, and of exhaust gases during operation.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The
generated know how will be applicable to alternative fuels including systems
causing particulate matter from synthetic fuels, to capture unburned NH3
in NH3-ICE or urea particulates from selective catalytic reduction (SCR)
on H2-ICE. This project will utilize state of the art magnetic
resonance technology, such as rheo-NMR techniques to study the flow of
catalytic washcoat slurry into the porous walls of the ceramic material, as
arises during fabrication of the monolith, to understand deposition patterns
and resultant pore structure. It will also use hyperpolarised xenon MRI, an
emerging technology at the forefront of airway imaging in medicine, to study
the gas flow patterns in finished monoliths to understand the impact of mass
transport heterogeneity on the efficiency of filtration and the activity of the
catalyst&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

          <span style="font-weight: 700;">About Durham Filtration:</span>
          <br> Durham Filtration Ltd. has the strategic intent to
become a renowned technical authority in the field of flue-gas filtration for
large-scale industrial combustion plants, particularly in the Energy-from-Waste
and Biomass Energy markets of the UK and Europe. We have invested heavily in
R&amp;D to support this aim over the past 5 years with projects placed at
Universities of Newcastle, Teesside and Sheffield in addition to KTP
collaborations.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Our main business lies in providing filtration services
to waste to energy and biomass plant operated by Viridor, Veolia, Sembcorp,
Suez and E.On using combustion and gasification technologies.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We aim to provide best practice filtration technologies,
continuous improvement and innovative solutions for financial and environmental
benefits. In return, we have access to plant and commercial data and the
ability to trial our innovations using industrial samples or at full commercial
scale.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">R &amp; D plans:</span>
          <br>DF have plans to recruit 4 PhD students in total on an
annual basis to assist in developing our R &amp; D effort in support of our
commercial activities. DF envisage, should the opportunities arise, that these
students could grow with the company as it expands its activities in this
expanding sector as the UK engages with technologies that assist in reducing
CO2 emissions. DF have benefited from this recruitment route in recent years.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We have a plan to enhance our capability at our Jarrow
Facility and have constructed a filtration characterisation and testing
laboratory, which allows us to conduct all the current industry standard
measurements for post-operational flue gas filtration media. We are aware of
the plans of Sheffield University to recover from the flooding at Beighton and
we are committed to enhancing our current lab capabilities by constructing a
new filtration and combustion characterisation laboratory. This new facility
will leverage the existing knowhow within Sheffield University and will serve
to replace much of the capability formerly located at the Beighton pilot facility,
whilst also evolving the University’s capability to reflect current industrial
needs. We have allowed for a significant footprint of our Jarrow facility to be
used for this purpose, with room for expansion in mind.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>Durham Filtration intends to work with Sheffield
University to develop our next-generation of innovations for our customers.
This includes a commitment to support EngD and PhD candidates with industrial
placements, supervise and mentor final year undergraduates with industrially
relevant research, and fund KTP associates. We will also commit to jointly
pursuing additional funding and grants as may be relevant to the research, and
to jointly deliver all impacts, outputs and deliverables required to fulfil the
conditions of the same.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>We
envisage that this phase in our growth strategy will last at least four years,
during which time we will actively pursue, fund and support commercialisation
and publication of our jointly developed innovations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>
          <span style="font-weight: 700;">EngD proposal:</span>
          <br>Currently, there is an expansion in the UK for the
provision of power and heat from waste to energy and biomass combustion plant
which assist the UK Government in its goal to reduce CO2 emissions while
solving disposal problems. However, this type of plant generates particulate
emissions, <br> particularly
PM2.5, which provides technological challenges in their control due to their
size and health hazard potential. Increasingly stringent emissions control
legislation means that existing technology will need to be improved while
maintaining operational efficiency. This provides challenges to minimise outage
caused by filter failures in baghouses where higher performance filter
installation can highlight weaknesses in designs related to optimisation of flue
gas flow patterns as well as identification of regions of high material
stresses by simulation work.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>It
is recognised that particulate control from biomass gasification processes
presents different sets of challenges and we will work with customers using
this technology to offer improved systems as an outcome from the areas of
research proposed below.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>To assist in developing these high specification
systems, DF would like to sponsor an EngD student to start in September 2023
from the Resilient Decarbonisation CDT at Sheffield. DF have plans to fund up
to 4 PhD students and we have outlined below the proposed topics. All projects
are related to particulate emissions control from energy from waste and biomass
combustion/gasification plant.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The exact project will be decided
after interview with students to match interests and capabilities.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br><b>Topics:</b>
          <br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Develop a predictive toolkit for
filtration asset owners to give quantitative predicted time-to-failure or
optimal regions of operation (economic or environmental optima). Analyse,
interpret, and visualise a high volume of data from a filtration specific sensor
platform installed in a UK biomass combustion and gasification plant. Integrate
with existing plant data collection methods and provide a structured model for
plant performance. Develop a reporting package to deliver data visualisations
to the end user in a meaningful way, reporting on the benefit of any corrective
action predicted by the model.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->To run experimental programmes on
the new combustion test facility hosted by DF at their Jarrow facility. The
project will investigate the generation of particulate material under pilot
plant operating conditions from a range of fuel blends that are typical of
energy from waste and biomass energy plant. The controlled conditions of the
CTF will be used to focus on issues created by particular fuel blends which is
not possible by the analysis of industrially harvested samples from full scale
plant. The results will be complimentary and combined they will offer insight
into design solutions that can be offered by DF to the industry.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Develop new marketable products or
services to address the common issues found across plants. Provide the
mechanical design, simulation, prototyping and validation of any developed
equipment and assist in its commercialisation. Initially, a sorbent
distribution nozzle is envisaged to address the issue of poor sorbent mixing in
the flue gas treatment stream.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Develop new test methods and metrics
for quantifying ‘filter health’ with meaningful interpretations for end users.
Evolve the current ISO testing standards, based on old textile manufacture
methods, to bring about a new, market-specific testing standard and industrial
best practice. Using a wealth of industrial samples, build a library of data
and assist with model-based predictions of filter performance.&nbsp;<!--[if !supportLists]-->
          <br>
          <br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <!--[endif]-->Develop our understanding of
Computational Fluid Dynamics, bringing our market offering up to the state of
the art. Simulate filter media at the micro- and macro-scale, and provide
approximations at the plant scale. Simulate filtration cleaning systems
dynamically, at high spaciotemporal resolution. Develop CFD integrated
optimisation frameworks or generative design methods to optimise geometries and
develop novel solutions for common plant issues.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
