        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The aim of the PhD project is to investigate the
creep and creep fatigue behaviours of CSEF power plant steels subject to
realistic plant loading cycles. <br>
          <br>The current market conditions are such that
combined cycle gas turbine (CCGT) plants are now considering double two-shift
operation, so potentially accruing upwards of 600 starts per year. The pressure
to reduce the extent of pressure system inspections and repairs continues to
increase, with the most recent capacity auction clearing prices for generation
showing a significant reduction when compared to previous years. For operators
of large generation facilities, the key consideration is the through life revenue
return, which will guide decisions on new plant builds and any capital
investments on plant currently operating. On this basis the need for effective
life prediction and condition monitoring tools to support the supply chain
(designer, fabricator, operator and technical service provider) is evident. <br>
          <br>Over the years, significant development has been
made on the 9–12%Cr creep strength enhanced ferritic (CSEF) steels.
Traditionally, in material development for power plant components, creep
ductility, which can be treated as resistance to damage, has received much less
attention. However, the risk of catastrophic failure due to low damage
tolerance is a real challenge, in particular, in the situation where mechanical
and metallurgical constraints are present. In addition, due to the increasing
frequency of cyclic operations, i.e. starts up and shut downs for main steam
pipelines of power plants, low cycle creep fatigue failure due to low ductility
of the materials has become an important concern. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project is to investigate creep
and creep fatigue behaviour which takes into account the variable ductility for
CSEF power plant steels subject to realistic plant loading cycles, through a
comprehensive theoretical, experimental and computational programme.<br>

recycling&nbsp;technologies.</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> We are seeking applicants with a process
engineering background to start in Autumn 2022 on a project with Mitsubishi
Chemical UK Ltd. The funded studentship is the result of a major expansion of a
programme to decarbonise the entire value chain around acrylic polymer
manufacturing. Chemical recycling of current and legacy acrylic materials is a
key challenge that needs to be met in order to realise the broader
decarbonisation programme, and microwave heating has been identified as a key
enabling technology that can meet this challenge. Mitsubishi Chemical have
partnered with the University of Nottingham to carry out this work due to their
world-leading expertise in microwave heating technologies. The partnership aims
to better understand the impact of material properties and processing
conditions on recycled product and its ability to displace fossil resources in
the acrylic manufacturing process. A continuous, industrial-scale demonstration
process will be developed towards the end of the programme. <br>
          <br>The aim of the PhD project will be to gain better
understanding of how both microwave and conventional heating technologies can
be used to process waste plastic and produce monomer product that is of
sufficient quality to re-use in acrylic manufacture. Working with the industry
partner, other PhD students and project team members the successful candidate
will establish and model concepts for refining feedstock and crude monomer to
the required quality, where challenges will be around variable feedstock
composition and the separation of close-boiling components. These refining
processes will be combined with new technologies for acrylic recycling to
produce a number of system-level process models that can be used to establish
feedstock-technology-product relationships. These models will in turn be used
to direct technology development for recycling processes and to develop a
broader industry implementation strategy for recycled acrylic, optimising the
acrylic circular value chain. <br>
          <br>This is an excellent opportunity for an
enthusiastic first or upper second class graduate in a process engineering
discipline to develop expertise and key skills in the sustainable manufacture
and recycling of plastics, and to establish relationships with international
academic and industrial partners. <br>
          <br>The project will be part of the EPSRC-supported
Centre for Doctoral Training (CDT) "Resilient Decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems".
The student who undertakes it will be one of a cohort of over 50 students in a
broad range of disciplines across the Universities of Sheffield, Nottingham and
Cardiff.

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Improving the water-handling of proton exchange membrane cells</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Hydrogen proton exchange membrane fuel cells (PEMFCs) are a key
technology in enabling the transition to net-zero carbon energy.&nbsp; Hydrogen powered fuel cell stacks have been
demonstrated to be eminently suitable for powering cars and especially trucks,
because battery solutions are not viable for most larger vehicles. A recent
Hydrogen Council report (link below) emphasises the synergy in using both
battery electric vehicles (BEVs) and fuel cell electric vehicles (FCEVs) to
have a major impact on transport derived CO2 emissions. The heavy duty truck
market is expected to be the first to become fully commercialised FCEV
application due to the less-demanding infrastructure network requirements.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>However, a key issue severely impacting the performance and efficiency
of PEMFCs is water flooding. Water flooding occurs in the cathode-side catalyst
layer whereby water generated in the cathode reaction condenses out in the
pores of the catalyst support thereby blocking access for in-coming oxygen.
Hydrophobic ionomer is added to the cathode catalyst layer to attempt to
mitigate against flooding. In order to design the optimal formulation and
fabrication process for the cathode catalyst layer, it is necessary to
understand the relationship between the properties of the layer, especially
pore size, pore connectivity and surface wettability/hydrophobicity, and the
performance in the actual PEMFC. However, it has been found that current
characterisation methods used are unable to distinguish sufficiently between
the pore network and wettability characteristics of different layers to predict
differences in their eventual PEMFC performance. Hence, new characterisation
techniques are needed, and this is the aim of this project. The objectives of
this project are to test three such candidate techniques for suitability. NMR
spectroscopy and relaxometry of hyperpolarised (hp) krypton and xenon have been
shown to be sensitive probes of pore size and the spatial distribution of
hydro-phobic/-philic surfaces within a probed network. We, thus, intend to test
hp Kr and hp Xe NMR techniques for determining the spatial distribution of
ionomer and inception of water adsorption within cathode pore networks. The
second candidate is adsorption calorimetry. Previous combined gravimetric and calorimetric
studies of gas uptake in gas shales have suggested the technique can readily
assess the spatial arrangement and juxtaposition of pore condensate in complex
geometries, and its impact on mass transport. This technique will also be tried
on catalyst layers. Finally, serial water adsorption and mercury porosimetry
studies on catalyst pellets have revealed that this method can characterise the
spatial distribution of the adsorbed water and the impact on percolation
pathways within the pore network, and will thus be tested on cathode catalyst
layers. We will also aim to develop a characterisation technique that can be
used as a quality control, near-to-line measurement during manufacturing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Hydrogen combustion in large-scale decarbonised heat and power plants</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Hydrogen is an important energy vector for future
industry and a significant amount of research is underway to decarbonise heavy
industry by using hydrogen as a fuel for heat and power. Processes which
traditionally rely on natural gas must quickly adapt to using hydrogen as a
fuel and this has resulted in a need for new, flexible burner technologies
capable of working with hydrogen along with a variety of other gas fuels.
Hydrogen is a challenging fuel due to its
inherent properties, such as flame speed, heat release rate, density and
optical properties. This research project will involve closely working with an
industrial burner engineering company to study the underpinning science of
fuel-flexible hydrogen burners at large scales. It is expected that this
project will involve analytical, design and investigative work, including
practical measurement of combustion phenomena.
Ideally, this studentship would suit somebody with
a strong background in science / engineering, including skills in
experimentation / computer aided design and simulation.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
