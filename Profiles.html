          <br>My study seeks to explore the idea of using biological
enzymes immobilised on a biochar framework to convert carbon dioxide (CO2)
to methanol (CH3OH). Biological enzymes present a powerful and
sustainable alternative to inorganic catalysis; however, they also present a
challenge. Enzymes must be robust enough to work within adverse environments,
such as CO2 exhaust outflows. Free enzymes in solution also create
unfeasibly high operational costs due to low recovery rates. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>One of the most effective ways to solve these issues is
through immobilization; unfortunately, many studies are limited by complex
methodology and loss of enzyme activity. Biochar has recently emerged as a
stable, inert, and economical matrix for enzyme immobilisation that could
overcome these limitations. As opposed to being bound onto the matrix - which
impacts activity - enzymes are instead held in place on the biochar by surface
functional groups. This could create a bio-catalytic system that provides
enzyme stability without affecting functionality; offering industries
struggling to decarbonise a CO2-capture technology that generates an
economic return on the significant investment required to implement
capture-based solutions.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>This study will begin by engineering biochar from
sustainable UK-based forestry products to ensure its physiochemistry
facilitates optimal enzyme attachment and activity. Then, it will determine the
optimal conditions (pH, time, temperature, enzyme and ionic concentration) for
enzyme binding. It will then test bio-catalysis of CO2 to methanol
in pure CO2 and flue gas. Finally, if the study proof-of-concept is
achieved, I hope to conduct lifecycle, technoeconomic and pathways-to-market
analyses to determine process sustainability and identify pathways to
accelerate technology uptake and adoption.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>In 2018 alone, methanol production from fossil fuels
contributed 211 million tonnes of CO2 emissions into the atmosphere.
If proof of concept is achieved; this novel technology could replace the use of
fossil fuels in methanol manufacturing, demand for which has reached 98 million
tonnes in 2018 and is increasing. It could also create an opportunity for CCUS
investment in growing industries struggling to eliminate CO2
emissions, such as the cement and steel industry, which contribute over 9% of
global CO2 emissions. Methanol will also continue to be in demand in
the future as a source of hydrogen for fuel cell vehicles and for conversion to
dimethyl ether - a super clean diesel fuel for transport. This provision of
sustainable methanol could assist in transport decarbonisation, transport is
currently responsible for 6% of global CO2 output.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The leading method for CO2 capture and
conversion to methanol is via rare-metal catalysis, which is associated with
expense and sustainability concerns. This biocatalytic method will overcome
these barriers by utilising biochar as the reaction matrix, to which the
enzymes are attached. Biochar and enzymes are renewable, widely available, and
affordable, which could result in a lower carbon footprint and a more
competitive process. Also, the enzyme-mediated conversion performs optimally at
lower temperatures and pressures, making it more energy-efficient.
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>This would be the first study of its kind to use biochar in
a multi-enzyme cascade system. It is hoped that proof of the system’s concept
will incentivise further investigations into enzyme-mediated carbon capture.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

offered a position within the Resilient Decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems
CDT.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>The project aims to develop and improve upon a
decarbonisation system for iron and steelmaking emissions, inspired by my time
with Tata Steel. With a specific focus on the blast furnaces that make pig
iron, I am looking into using chemical absorption to decarbonise the blast
furnace gas. Blast furnace gas poses unique challenges when compared with
conventional flue gases from energy generation, specifically by carrying a
higher carbon dioxide content and by having both carbon monoxide and hydrogen
present. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>My research involves both experimental and simulation work,
taking place at the Translational Energy Research Centre.&nbsp; Using the Amine Capture Plant, I will
investigate capturing carbon dioxide from simulated blast furnace gas, and
attempt to optimise the system for a number of conditions. The simulation side
of the work will help identify these conditions in a model of the plant, and
then assess potential improvements for such a system to improve efficiencies.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">My academic background stems from my undergraduate degree in Mechanical
Engineering which I read at Cardiff University. In which I completed a
dissertation in developing a BEMT code for tidal stream turbines in low flow
conditions. As a part of my UG degree, I undertook a year’s placement at RWE’s
CCGT Power Station in Pembroke. This informed my academic and career prospects
thereafter. I followed my UG degree with a Masters in Sustainable Energy &amp;
Environment, again awarded by Cardiff University. Within my Masters studies I
gained appreciation for the role of combustion and how it is necessary to
decarbonise said systems. My Master’s dissertation was focused on developing an
understanding on how to effectively position tidal stream turbines for maximum
power output and minimal loading.&nbsp;<br>
          <br>My project is to investigate the effects on introducing
hydrogen into the gas grid on current generating assets. Since hydrogen is far
more reactive than natural gas, it is necessary to characterise its behaviour
in current generating assets, whilst taking into account a range of
intermediate mixture fractions. The aim is to realise hydrogen implementation
in said assets to introduce further carbon abatement in the Gas Turbine Power
industry.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"><b>Overview&nbsp;</b> This Resilient Decarbonised Fuel Energy Systems PhD project is
investigating the use of sensor measurements and machine learning to predict
and optimise either the energy production or energy utilisation for a range of
industrial relevant case studies. The PhD project is being sponsored by the industrial
partner Intelligent Plant, who focus on the analysis and visualisation of
industrial data. Although the project will focus on different case studies, the
aim is to determine suitable data collection and analysis strategies that can
be applied to a variety of different industrial systems. The first and second
case studies will focus on energy production systems and the third and fourth
on the energy efficiency of industrial processes. An objective of this project
is to develop appropriate data analysis and visualisation methods, which
contribute to the UK’s, net-zero ambition. &nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Case Study 1: Wind
Turbines &nbsp;</b> This case study will use data from offshore wind turbines provided
by the Offshore Renewable Energy Catapult. Predictive models and anomaly detection
will be developed to determine the energy produced for a variety of turbine
conditions e.g. wake effect, weather forecast and production output, prediction
of energy output in addition to determining the optimal conditions to maximise
energy production.<br>
          <br><b>Case Study 2:
False Positive Identification&nbsp;</b> Applying
machine learning to both alarm and process data in order to reduce fake alarms
and provide greater insight to how real an alarm is. For example: a client for
Intelligent plant has asked to look at alarms being raised because there was a
fire when there was not one, causing them to shut down and thereby reducing
their energy output. This can also be applied to many other different scenarios
across the industry.&nbsp;<br>
          <br><b>Case study
3: Industry Baking&nbsp;</b> This case study will use data (e.g. temperature, residence time)
from industrial bakeries and develop models to determine the optimal parameters
of different unit operations (e.g. baking and cooling) to minimise the energy
utilised whilst ensuring the product remain within specification.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><b>&nbsp;</b>
          <br><b>Case Study 4: Brewing</b>&nbsp;
This
case study will use data collected from local breweries to monitor the energy
usage through key operations (e.g. fermentation and wort boiling and cleaning)
and develop models to monitor processes and reduce energy utilisation. For
example, data analysis from sensors to monitor different variables during the
fermentation process help to minimise the length of fermentation, resources
being used while increasing product quality and safety.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2">I am a member of the 2019/20
cohort for the RDFES CDT. My project is entitled, “Theoretical and Experimental
Investigation into the Chemical Kinetic Mechanism for High-Pressure
Combustion”. The project looks at developing a high-pressure chemical kinetic
mechanism for the combustion of different fuels in CO2. The
Allam-Fetvedt cycle is a high-pressure combustion cycle of methane or syngas in
a 96% dilution of CO2, a regime where the kinetics of combustion are
poorly understood. The experimental portion of the project has involved the
design and fabrication of a high-pressure shock tube for the University of
Sheffield’s (UoS) new Translational Energy Research Centre. A shock tube is a
device for generating instantaneous high-pressure and temperature conditions,
which allows for the combustion of different fuels to be measured through
various diagnostic techniques. The UoS shock tube will total 10.5 metres in
length and be capable of generating post shock pressures and temperatures of
100 bar and 2000 K respectively and should be completed and commissioned by the
end of 2022. The theoretical side of the project utilises Chemkin Pro to model
high pressure combustion data generated using shock tubes. I have used existing
ignition delay time data to validate existing chemical kinetic models for
modelling the combustion of hydrogen, syngas, and methane in order to create
UoS sCO2 2.0, a mechanism designed for modelling combustion in CO2.

Optimised Pellet Quality.<br>
          <br>Biomass has the potential
to dramatically improve our environment, economy and energy security if it is
used as an energy source in large scale. This project will develop a novel
holistic biomass pelleting process, which will aim to minimise drying energy
and improve pellet quality. The system will include a low carbon drying system
based around novel technologies to minimise energy consumption for drying. The
potential to incorporate torrefaction and pelleting into one system in
conjunction with higher moisture contents biomasses will be investigated to
reduce drying and transport requirements. Full characterisation of biomass
resources will be conducted, and the options available at each stage of the
process will be investigated prior to the development of the full system. By
assessing the system options with Life Cycle Analysis (LCA), the optimal low
energy process can be identified and compared to existing systems.&nbsp;<br>

        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The UK government has set itself the target of achieving net zero
carbon emissions by 2050. This means that while there will likely be some
residual emissions in 2050, they should all be mitigated/offset through carbon
capture solutions.&nbsp;
&nbsp;<br>
          <br>My work analyses data collected through the Delivering Net Zero
Project; a UKRI funded set of workshops that gathered information from
academics and stakeholders from the public, private and third sector. Our goal
is to be able to inform UKRI of where it should be focusing its funding and
research efforts in order to reach the net zero target.&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>
          <br>More specifically I'll be looking into what narratives are
developing concerning Net Zero, narratives such as: what changes need to be
made to the energy supply system, how and why people should move around the
country, and what everyday behaviours will likely have to change to reduce our
energy demand. If any differences exist between the groups and backgrounds of
the people who took part in the workshops, they will be identified and
discussed. Finally, I'll be exploring what any dominant narratives would mean
for different people and groups throughout the UK.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

operate under high temperature and pressure conditions to cope with the increasing
derive towards improved thermal efficiency and reduced carbon emissions.
However, under such conditions, creep deformation and fracture become major
concerns. This necessitates the development of improved constitutive material
modelling and robust life assessment procedures to maintain the structural
integrity of high-temperature components. This project aims to investigate
creep and creep-fatigue deformation mechanisms of CSEF powerplant steels at
high temperatures, through a comprehensive theoretical, experimental and
